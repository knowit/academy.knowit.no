# About the workshop

Agile development is all about succeeding in our efforts with the help of
short, meaningful feedback loops. If we're not succeeding, then we ought to
change our practices. If we are succeeding, then we should not care what to
call it.

The goal is not to be agile, but to succeed. With that thought in mind, we ask
what set of technical practices can lead to sustainable development and reduce
risk?

This course focuses on some of the technical practices that developers can
apply to succeed in their agile development. The content is targeted towards
midlevel to senior developers, lead develoers, those who can influence and
participate towards the success of their teams' application development. This
course involves a good balance of lectures and hands-on exercises. Certain
parts will involve writing code and certain parts will involve devising a
design or coming up with architectural recommendations.

# What you'll learn

- Creating evolutionary design: Approaches to mitigate risks
- Design Patterns: from problem to pattern via principles
- Influence of lambdas on Patterns
