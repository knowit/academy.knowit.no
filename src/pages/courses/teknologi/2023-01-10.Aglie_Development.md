Agile development is all about succeeding in our efforts with the help of
short, meaningful feedback loops. If we're not succeeding, then we ought to
change our practices. If we are succeeding, then we should not care what to
call it.

The goal is not to be agile, but to succeed. With that thought in mind, what
set of practices, when done correctly, can help us improve the chances of
success and lower the chances of failures? That's the question this course
will answer.

This course takes a highly practical and result driven approach to being
agile. It will present the major impediments, things we have to deeply
introspect and change. It will discuss why adaptive planning is highly
essential and how to get the team to working in that mode. It has a good
mixture of technical and non-technical details to help adapt, succeed and
sustain agile development.
